             places them, but as you've probably noticed this has left our page very left side heavy.</span>
             <span class = "b" float: right>If your elements are still not exactly where you want them to be after adjusting the padding, margins and alignment,
             then you can try out the float property. The "float" property is one of the most powerful tools you can master when learning CSS.</span>

            <span class = "c">Elements underneath a floating object will automatically wrap themselves around content. For example, if you float an image,
             the text underneath will wrap around it so that none of it is actually obscured underneath the image.</span>
             <span class = "d">The float property liberates an elemnt from its automatic position and lifts it up to "float" on top of other elements
             in the direction you specify. You can specify float either right, left, or the default of none.</span>
